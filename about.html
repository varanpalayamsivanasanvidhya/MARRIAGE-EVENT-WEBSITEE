        <h1>HINDU WEDDING </h1>
        <p>A Hindu wedding, also known as Vivaha is the traditional wedding ceremony for Hindus. The wedding ceremonies are very colourful, and celebrations may extend for several days and usually a large number of people attend the wedding functions. The bride's and groom's home—entrance, doors, wall, floor, roof—are sometimes decorated with colors, flowers, and other decorations,

            The word vivāha originated as a sacred union of two people as per Vedic traditions, i.e. what many call marriage, but based on cosmic laws and advanced ancient practices.Under Vedic Hindu traditions, marriage is viewed as one of the saṁskāras performed during the life of a human being, which are lifelong commitments of one wife and one husband, In India, marriage has been looked upon as having been designed by the cosmos and considered as a "sacred oneness witnessed by fire itself",Hindu families have traditionally been patrilocal.
            In Hinduism, marriage joins two individuals or embodied, eternal souls for the purpose of jointly pursuing the purushartha or four aims of life: dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. Marriage is considered a spiritual partnership which unites the minds, bodies, and souls of the partners in this and future lives, and builds sacred bonds between their two families. </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:20px ;">HALDI</h2>
        <P>The haldi ceremony is a ritual in which a mixture of turmeric (haldi), oil and water are applied to both the bride and groom prior to the wedding. Family members will wipe the mixture on the couple and offer their blessings and ward off any evil spirits so that they can start their new life obstacle free.</P>
            <img src="images/haldi.jpg" width="750">
        <h2 style="margin-top:20px ;">MEHANDI</h2>
           <P>Another popular ceremony is the mehndi (henna) ceremony, which occurs a day or two prior to the wedding ceremony. In this ceremony, the bride is decorated on her hands and feet with henna powder which is wet when applied but dries to an orangish-red stain. It said that the deeper the color of the bride’s mehndi, the happier the bride and groom’s marriage will be. Bridal mehndi designs often incorporate ornate thematic designs of well wishes, joy, and love. Often, the groom’s name is usually hidden somewhere in the intricate patterns and game rules dictate he must find it. While traditionally, mehndi was reserved for the bride and the women in her family, it is now common to see the groom also get a bit of mendhi as well.

            Wedding rituals embrace the five elements of nature: fire, earth, water, air and ether, and include invocations to the Divine, followed by vows. It is conducted in the presence of a sacred fire, representing the God of Fire (Agni). Agni exists as a divine and impartial witness to the vows taken by the bride and groom and symbolizes the light of knowledge which is the key to everlasting happiness.</P>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">GROOM WELCOME</h2>
        <p>The bride’s mother welcomes the groom, often with a vermillion forehead marking (kumkum tilak), waving of a diya, or earthen lamp on a decorative plate, a small offering of jaggery or sugar, sprinkling water and rice in all directions. The groom will then step onto a clay vessel crushing it to pieces, assuring the parents that he has the ability, strength, and determination to overcome all obstacles that the couple may face in their married life.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">GANESH POOJA</h2>
<P>Nearly every rite of passage, weddings being no exception, begin with an invocation to Lord Ganesh, the Remover of Obstacles and embodiment of knowledge and auspicious endeavors. This ceremony invites him after symbolically purifying the surroundings and ritual participants. Rice, flowers, and fruit may be offered as a sign of hospitality and worshipful respect to the deity.</P>

<h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">CHRISTIAN WEDDING  </h1>
<p> Christian weddings are widely known for their elegance and simplicity. Indian and Western traditions are harmoniously merged during Christian marriages in India. If you have ever attended an Indian Christian wedding, you must know that each state and community has its own traditions. While maintaining their Indian culture, the Indian Christians have also embraced some Western traditions. The wedding fashions and ceremonies reflect this blending of Indo-Western traditions. The following are the main customs and rituals that are followed in an Indian Christian wedding:</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px ;">RINGS EXCHANGE</h3>
    <P>At this moment in the wedding ceremony, the Bride and Groom face each other and exchange their heart as ring</P>

<h2 style="margin-top:20px ;">WEDDING VOWS</h2>
<P>At this moment in the wedding ceremony, the Bride and Groom face each other.

    The wedding vows are the central focus of the service. The Bride and Groom promise publicly, before God and the witnesses present, to do everything within their power to help each other grow and become what God has created them to be, despite all adversities, as long as they both shall live. The wedding vows are sacred and express the entrance into a covenant relationship.</P>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">RECESSIONAL</h2>
<P>The couple comes back down the aisle and exits the house of worship officially married. The couple is immediately followed down the aisle by their ring bearers and flower girls, then their wedding party, then parents and important family members, and, finally, the minister. “Having the minister as first in and very last out marks the beginning and end of the ceremony,”</P>

<h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">MUSLIM WEDDING  </h1>
<img src="images/7.webp" width="750px">
<p>Muslim wedding in South Asia is sure to be a beautiful and celebratory affair. "South Asian weddings are always known and loved for their multiple-day events," says Campbell. He goes on to share that "a tradition popular in Bangladesh and parts of India is the Gaye Holud. At this prewedding event, both the bride and groom have turmeric spread on their skin and sing, dance, and celebrate their upcoming wedding with their family</p>
<img src="images/mu1.jpg" width="750px">


<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">NIKAH</h2>
<p>"The nikah (or katb Al kitab) is, in short, a Muslim marriage ceremony," says Campbell. "The basis of this ceremony is the signing of the Muslim marriage contract. In Muslim-majority countries, this contract will act as both a religious and civil agreement (meaning this is what the government will use to legally recognize the marriage). The nikah ceremony is usually held in a mosque; however, in the US, especially in rural areas or places that don't have significant Muslim communities, a Nikah is often a very intimate family affair held at home. A nikah can be overseen by an Imam, a Qazi (Islamic judge), or any Muslim who has a deep understanding of Islamic traditions," such as a Maulvi.</p>
<img src="images/nika.jpg" width="750px">

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;"> MAHR</h2>
<P>Khan goes on to explain that "going completely by the book for an Islamic wedding, the Nikah is required and a Mehr, and witnesses to the marriage. But based on regionality and the ethnicity of the couple, there will be cultural aspects that will play part in it. From a religious perspective for a Muslim wedding, it's the actual ceremony itself that matters which is about 10-15 minutes. For South Asian weddings, however, it is many days and very extended because a lot of the pieces of a wedding for a couple from a South Asian background are influenced by the culture of the region where they are from, whether it's Pakistan or India. So across different religions, there are a lot of different wedding events that are shared by different religious groups because they are more culturally part of a wedding</P>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">SURAH AL-FATIHAH</h2>
<p>Surah Al-Fatihah
    This is the reading of the first chapter of the Quran which generally marks the beginning of an Islamic couple's engagement.
